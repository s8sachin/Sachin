# Thomas (father) and Martha (mother) have a son named Bruce. 
# Bruce gets his second name from his mother and last name from his father. 
# So the complete name of their son is 'Bruce Martha Thomas'.
# help Bruce get his first name, last name and full name.


# Fix the below code such that .
# 1. When asked for firstName it should give their son's name.
# 2. When asked for secondName it should only give the mothers name.
# 3. when asked for lastName it should only give the father's name.
# 4. when asked for fullName it should give 'Bruce Martha Thomas'.


# -----valid output-----
# firstName -> Bruce
# secondName -> Martha
# lastName -> Thomas
# fullName -> My name is Bruce Martha Thomas

# -----Invalid output----- 

# fullName -> Bruce Martha Thomas
